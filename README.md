# slideshow-project
This was an attempt to create a slideshow that was inspired by an example I read through on W3Schools. The JavaScript code is wholly different from the example on W3Schools. In particular, this project strengthened my familiarity with adding Event Listeners to buttons which allow the user to move left or right in the slideshow. There are also dots with event listeners which, if clicked, bring up the relevant image that it is linked to. Furthermore, this project introduced me to adding event listeners to the window. The reason I added event listeners to the window was that if the user pressed the left or right arrow key, they could browse through the photos in the slideshow. Finally, upon the webpage loading, a function is called which causes the slideshow to run automatically (this involves using setInterval to call a function every 5 seconds provided certain conditions are met). However, it is written in such a way that if the user clicks any button or presses the left or right arrow key, the automatic show stops.
